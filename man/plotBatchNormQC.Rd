\usage{
plotBatchNormQC(raw_object = NULL, norm_object = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_object}{Dataset prior to batch normalisation}

\item{norm_object}{Dataset after batch normalisation}
}
\value{
A boxplot created with ggplot2
}
\description{
Creates a boxplot that depicts the library sizes of each batch in a dataset.
This function is for the comparison of pre- and post- batch-normalised 
datasets that have been loaded into an EMSet. Cells found in these datasets 
must have the same identifiers.
}
\examples{
# Load example EMSet 
raw_object <- ascend::raw_set

# Run batch normalisation
norm_object <- normaliseBatches(raw_object)

# Generate plot
plot <- plotBatchNormQC(raw_object = raw_object, norm_object = norm_object)

}
