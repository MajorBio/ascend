\usage{
plotPCA(object, PCX = 1, PCY = 2, group = NULL, density = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{\linkS4class{EMSet}} object that has undergone PCA.}

\item{PCX}{Principal component to plot on the x-axis.}

\item{PCY}{Principal component to plot on the y-axis.}

\item{group}{(Optional) Name of the column in colInfo that 
describe a set of conditions you would like to colour cells by.}

\item{density}{Vary alpha by density (Default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
A ggplot glob that contains a scatter plot.
}
\description{
Plot two principal components (PCs) on a scatter plot. This plot corresponds
more closely to the distance between points and therefore is good to use
to review the effectiveness of clustering by the CORE algorithm.
}
\examples{
# Load EMSet
em_set <- ascend::analyzed_set

# Generate PCA plot
pca_plot <- plotPCA(em_set, PCX = 1, PCY = 2, 
group = "cluster", density = TRUE)

}
