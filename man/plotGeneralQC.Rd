\usage{
plotGeneralQC(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{\linkS4class{EMSet}} object.}
}
\value{
A list of plot objects.
}
\description{
This function generates a series of plots that can be used to assess the
present quality of an EMSet.
}
\details{
The plots are as follows:
\itemize{
\item{\strong{Library Size per Cell}: A series of barplots depicting the 
library size of each cell in descending order.}
\item{\strong{Library Size}: A histogram depicting the distribution of 
library sizes across the dataset.}
\item{\strong{Average Gene Count}: A histogram depicting number of cells vs 
mean gene expression.}
\item{\strong{Average Gene Count (Log2)}: A histogram depicting number of 
cells vs Log2 mean gene expression.}
\item{\strong{Average Gene Count (Log10)}: A histogram depicting number of 
cells vs Log2 mean gene expression.}
\item{\strong{Log 10 Average Gene Count (Smooth Scatter)}: Smooth scatter 
plot of number of cells vs Log10 mean gene expression.}
\item{\strong{Top Genes Per Sample}: Violin/beehive plots depicting 
proportion of top genes to total cell expression per sample.}
\item{\strong{Top Gene Expression}: Boxplots depicting top 25 genes in terms 
of expression.}
}
If controls are defined, two additional plots are generated:
\itemize{
\item{\strong{Percentage Control Expression}: Histograms depicting number of 
cells with the contribution of control genes as a percentage of total counts.}
\item{\strong{Proportion of Control Expression}: Violin/beehive plots for 
each sample and control, depicting the proportion of controls to total 
expression.}
}

# Load EMSet
EMSet <- ascend::raw_set

# Plot general QC
general_qc_plots <- plotGeneralQC(EMSet)
