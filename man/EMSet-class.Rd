\description{
An \linkS4class{EMSet} is a S4 class that stores data in a format `ascend`` can 
easily work with for analysis.
}
\details{
This iteration of the \linkS4class{EMSet} inherits from the 
\code{\linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment}} superclass for integration into
Bioconductor.

`ascend`-specific slots are as follows:
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{colInfo}}{A data frame containing each cell identifier, its 
associated batch/sample and additional information such as conditions. This 
slot was called CellInformation in earlier versions of `ascend`.}

\item{\code{rowInfo}}{A data frame containing information a set of gene 
identifiers, such as gene symbols or ENSEMBL transcript identifiers. This 
data frame also holds information on controls and any information provided by 
the user. This slot was called GeneInformation in earlier versions of `ascend`.}

\item{\code{clusterAnalysis}}{Objects related to clustering - distance matrix and
hclust object}

\item{\code{log}}{A record of functions used on an \linkS4class{EMSet}.}
}}
